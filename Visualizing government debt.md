Graph 1 uses the web-based visualization tool on [OECD](https://data.oecd.org/). It talks about the general government debt in % of GDP in 2019. US's performance ranks 4th and is much below that of Japan but higher than OECD average.

Graph 2 uses an online free tool [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/) to make a comprehensive visualization. It exhibits the debt-to-GDP ratio for 47 countries from 1995 to 2019 in the format of grid of line charts.

Graph 3 uses the same dataset and tool as Graph 2 but a different visualization format. I chose the scatter plot and used colors to highlight the debt-to-GDP of specific countries over the period. It mainly shows the development trend of Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio. It also compares US's performance to that of Japan and the overall trend. We may find that US and Japan start from similar point but exhibits different trends. Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio increases rapidly, indicating that it frequently uses leverage to boost GDP. While US's debt-to-GDP ratio is controlled within an acceptable range.

From the exercise, I learned that different tools and formats would largely impact the final visualization and the message conveyed. The web-based visualization tool cannot modify the graph much, restricting the visualization. Using visualization tool, we can unlimitedly customize our visualization and design the graph to emphasize our main point. Graph 2 tells the development trand for all 47 countries over the period but Graph 3 focuses on Japan and US's development. For Graph 3, I chose the scatter format not line format as lines for 47 countries would make the graph messy. Highlghted dots will show the development trend clearly.

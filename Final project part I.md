### Outline
The project talks about diet habits across the world. It mainly focuses on below aspects:
1. Diet composition by food group
2. Diet composition by countries (related to GDP)
3. Change of diet composition - more diversified
4. Diet habits and health (optional)

### Datasets
Data source:
1. International food composition from [Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations](https://www.fao.org/infoods/infoods/tables-and-databases/en/)
2. Diet composition information from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/diet-compositions)
3. World health data from [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/data/gho)
4. Obesity data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/obesity#what-share-of-adults-are-obese)

I will select part of data based on food groups and countries to describe the dietary composition. Besides, I will combine the diet information with health information to see if there is any correlation.

### Method and medium
I will use Shorthand to complete the final project. I may use other tools (excel, tableau, flourish, etc.) in data visualization.

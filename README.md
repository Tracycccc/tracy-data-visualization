This portfolio includes what I learned from Telling Stories with Data at CMU

# About me
This is Tracy. I am a second-year Public Policy & Management student from Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon University. Before it, I had my undergraduate at the University of Hong Kong with majors in Accounting and Finance.

# What I hope to learn
I expect to learn about how to design a proper visualization to convey information efficiently. Besides, I am interested in any systematic methodology to evaluate and improve a visualization. I have determined to pursue finance as my career path. In finance, we usually make use of Microsoft Office tools to present information (may not be as fancy as Python or R). Data visualization is important when we communicate with colleages, clients, investors, and public. Though I may not become a data analyst in the future, the data visualization theory still works in finance industry.

# Portfolio
Here is my work in Telling Stories with Data.
### Data visualization critiques
#### Critique by Design
This assignment contains two parts. Firstly, it used Stephen Few's [Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf) to evaluate the [Food Insecurity by Household Characteristics](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/charts/80061/insecurity.png?v=5479.7) by USDA. Then it redesigned the visualization using the original data.

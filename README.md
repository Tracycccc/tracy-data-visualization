# About me
I am a second-year Public Policy & Management student from Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon University.

# What I hope to learn
I expect to learn about how to design a proper visualization to convey information efficiently. Besides, I am interested in any systematic methodology to evaluate and improve a visualization. I have determined to pursue finance as my career path. I believe data visualization will be an important part in communication.

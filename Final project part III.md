### Project summary
#### Target audience
The story targets on Chinese people who are troubled with obesity or care about physical fitness. The interviews helped a lot. Based on interviewee's feedback, when it came to diet, they would first think of health and fitness. As they were my audience, I got to know what they would like to learn when it came to the topic. Furthermore, I found that the increasing obesity rate was consistent with the increasing calories intake. I also searched for some articles about Chinese obesisty and Chinese diet to see how they developed the story. Most of them connected the change of diet composition with obesity and talked about the prevelance and negative impacts of obesity to raise attention. I decided to follow a similar logic to attract my target audience.

#### Changes from part II
1. Add the obesity information. Start with “Chinese are getting overweight” statement and then present the obesity prevalence and obesity rate.
2. Follow with reasons from the perspective of diet composition.
3. Add call to action to have a balanced diet; give the suggested calories intake and suggested diet.
4. Add more text to explain the logic

#### Design decisions
From part I to part III, also with some discussion practice, I learned about to tell a story with data is not to report data, but to give a narrative with clear call to action. Data visualization is just a support.
1. Part I - decide a broad topic: I did not have a clear idea on what to do, to be honest. I just browsed online to see anything that may interest me. I came accross the diet composition topic at that time and decided to pick that one as my final project. I did not think of any specific key ideas so simply provided some general sketches to depict the data (which made my future parts more struggling).
2. Part II - narrow down the topic: After discussion with classmates, I further scoped down the topic and made the it focused on Chinese diet compositions. I proposed one key point and two main reasons behind as the story body. However, I missed the call to action and did not fully reflect my target audience.
3. I think the discussion assginments helped a lot in my proejct. For example, in the last discussion, I chose narrative and "Why women are paid less". It kind of gave me some hint to tell a story of "Why obesity in China", how to set up the questions, state the conflict and put forward a resolution. In the control color discussion, I learned how to use colors to facilitate the information convey. I applied it in my project, such as using similar colors for the same group of data.

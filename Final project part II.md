### Adjustment based on feedback from instructors and classmates
After reflecting on the feedback, I realized that my part I illustration was kind of vague, which only showed the data but not the ideas. In part II, I dive into the "Diet Composition" topic and decide to investigate into Chinese diet compositions.

Initially I planned to compare the diet compositions of China and the U.S., as representatives of Eastern and Western countries. However, after sharing my ideas with classmates, I found that it was still too broad to be covered in a 1-minute presentation. At the same time, it does not have many practical implications. Therefore, I further scoped down and made the topic focused on Chinese diet compositions.

Below is my further-developed outline:
1. The diet composition of China
- An overview of the composition
- Consumption of main food (compared to world average)
- Consumption of meat, fruit and others (compared to world average)
- Caloric supply
(- Diet composition v.s. EAT-Lancet diet)
2. Reasons behind the difference
- Environment and climate
- Economic factors, urbanization, leisure
- Culture
3. Health implication

### Wireframes
**An overview of Chinese diet composition by food groups**
The kilocalories intake per person per day has doubled since 1960. Cereals remain as the major source of energy. Besides, there is an increasing diversity in food groups, adding to the energy intake.

**Why do Chinese like cereals so much?** (compare Chinese' consumption of cereal to world average)
The main food of Chinese is rice and wheat.

China has a long history of growing and consuming cereals and it has been one of the largest agricultural country that [ranks first](https://www.fao.org/china/fao-in-china/china-at-a-glance/en/) in the production of cereals. The monsoon climate and ample land makes it easier for Chinese to grow cereals.

**What is behind the food diversification?**

fat/oil: Daily meat consumption(fat?); economic development, market&trade, diversified food supply, leisure
meat,fat/oil,fruit intake increase with GDP growth

Increase in obesity/overweight



### User research
primary audience: 


Is the structure logical enough? Would it be better to put foward the two factors one by one following with the corresponding reason?
unmatch of the periods 
Will the story be too long? Any part that is unnecessary?
Will it be better to make the conclusion as the setup? E.g. start with "Chinese are getting overweight" and then follow with reasons from the perspective of diet composition.
Easy to follow? Story told in a logical way?

### Adjustment based on feedback from instructors and classmates
After reflecting on the feedback, I realized that my part I illustration was kind of vague, which only showed the data but not the ideas. In part II, I dive into the "Diet Composition" topic and decide to investigate into Chinese diet compositions.

Initially I planned to compare the diet compositions of China and the U.S., as representatives of Eastern and Western countries. However, after sharing my ideas with classmates, I found that it was still too broad to be covered in a 1-min presentation. At the same time, it does not have many practical implications. Therefore, I further shrunk the coverage and made the topic focused on Chinese diet compositions.

Below is my further-developed outline:
1. The diet composition of China
- An overview of the composition
- Consumption of main food (compared to world average)
- Consumption of meat, fruit and others (compared to world average)
- Caloric supply
- Diet composition v.s. EAT-Lancet diet
2. Reasons behind the difference
- Environment and climate
- Economic factors, urbanization, leisure
- Culture
3. Health implication

### Wireframes
overview of the composition - Diet compositions by food groups: cereal as the main food; increase in meat

Main food consumption - Per capita consumption of cereals by commodity type, daily kilocalories (rise&wheat): food supply/production, argriculture country

Daily caloric supply derived from carbohydrates, protein and fat: Daily meat consumption

Increase in obesity/overweight



### User research

Would it be better to make the corresponding reason right after the phenomenon or keep the current structure?
unmatch of the periods 
Will the story be too long? Any part that is unnecessary?
Will it be better to make the conclusion as the setup? E.g. start with "Chinese are getting overweight" and then follow with reasons from the perspective of diet composition.

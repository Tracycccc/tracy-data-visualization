### Adjustment based on feedback of part I
After reflecting on the feedback, I realize that my part I illustration is kind of vague, which only shows the data but not the ideas. In part II, I dive into the "Diet Composition" topic and decide to compare the diet habits of Eastern and Western countries as well as the health implication.

Below is my further-developed outline:
1. The regional difference in the diet composition between Eastern and Western countries
- An overview of composition difference
- Animal food
- Fruit
2. Reasons behind the difference
- Economic reason
- Environment and climate
- Cooking & eating diets
- Historic reason
3. Examples: China and US
4. Health implication

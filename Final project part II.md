### Adjustment based on feedback from instructors and classmates
After reflecting on the feedback, I realized that my part I illustration was kind of vague, which only showed the data but not the ideas. In part II, I dive into the "Diet Composition" topic and decide to investigate into Chinese diet compositions.

Initially I planned to compare the diet compositions of China and the U.S., as representatives of Eastern and Western countries. However, after sharing my ideas with classmates, I found that it was still too broad to be covered in a 1-minute presentation. Therefore, I further scoped down and made the topic focused on Chinese diet compositions.

Below is my further-developed outline:
1. An overview of Chinese diet composition
- Cereals remain as the major source of energy
- Diversification in food groups
2. Reasons behind the large proportion of cereals: history; high production volume
3. Reasons behind the diversification in food groups: economic development; increasing food supply

### Wireframes

**An overview of Chinese diet composition by food groups**

The kilocalories intake per person per day has doubled since 1960. Cereals remain as the major source of energy. Besides, there is an increasing diversity in food groups, adding to the energy intake.

**Why do Chinese like cereals so much?** (compare Chinese' consumption of cereal to world average)

The main food of Chinese is rice and wheat.

China has a long history of growing and consuming cereals and it has been one of the largest agricultural country that [ranks first](https://www.fao.org/china/fao-in-china/china-at-a-glance/en/) in the production of cereals. The monsoon climate and ample land makes it easier for Chinese to grow cereals.

**What is behind the food diversification?**

With the economic development, the progressing productivity and the booming market lead to an increase in food supply. At the same time, people's income level improves and they tend to pursue more diversified diets.

### User research
#### The target audience
People interested in the trend of Chinese diet, especially thoses who would like to keep fit and consumers who care about what they are eating.

#### Identify representative individuals to interview
I will interview a person who keeps fit and designs dietary meals by herself. Another two interviewees are general consumers who care about diet balance. The final interviewee is an elder who may experiece the change of diet. One of general consumers are American. All of other three are Chinese.

#### Interview script
Hi, here is my story about Chinese diet composition. Could you please take a review and answer some questions for me? Your feedback would help a lot in my further work!

**Questions:**
- Is the structure logical enough? Is it easy to follow? Would it be better to put foward the two factors one by one following with the corresponding reasons and analysis?
- Due to data collection, there is a time unmatch among graphs (e.g. some graphs end in 2013 and some in 2017). Will that be a problem to you?
- Will the story be too long? Is there any part that is unnecessary?
- Does the topic interest you? Is there anything you expect to see but I fail to include?
- Follow-up question: If you would like to see the health issues, how do you think I should change the structure? Shall I include it in the end as a conclusion/resolution? Or will it be better to make it as the setup? 

#### Findings from interviews
It is concise story that follows a logical way. The time unmatch in not that important, as people care more about the trend, though it will be a pity that they cannot see the most updated data. However, when it comes to "diet", the first thing that comes to people will be health. Therefore, people are more interested in how what we eat is compared to the standard/suggested diet and any health issues (e.g. obesity) along with current diet. It seems better if I throw out a phenomenon first and then perform analysis. It will be more straightforward and attractive.

#### Implementation plan
- Search for most recent data about the visualizations
- Compare the current diet composition to a standard diet
- Add Chinese obesity visualization. Start with "Chinese are getting overweight" statement and then follow with reasons from the perspective of diet composition.

### Next step
- Adjust based on feedback
- Add pictures & text & format to finish the story in Shorthand
- Polish the graphs
- Complete citations
- Practice & rehearsal
